# Project 2, ML Text Classification
In this project, the goal is to determine the sentiment of tweets. Specifically we will try to predict whether a tweet contained a negative or a positive emoji. We have tried several different methods, notably word2vec with logistic regression, word2vec with cnn and tfidf vectorizer with logistic regression.
